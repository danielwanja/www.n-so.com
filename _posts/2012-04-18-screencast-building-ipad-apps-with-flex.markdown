This is the description of the talk:

Join us for a session on building incredible iPad apps with Flex. Too good to be true? 
Actually the Flex SDK has a whole set of components and classes suited  to easily build 
iPad apps. I would even say it's the fastest and easiest way to build iPad apps out there. 
Don't believe me? Then come and see how I unravel the hidden gems of the Flex SDK 
and build 10 application in less than 60 minutes. You will learn how easy it is to build 
powerful view navigation with little code. You will explore all the different components that 
the Flex SDK provides you. Additionally you will learn in this code intense talk how to build 
effective custom item renders. Wait, there is even more, we'll throw in tips and tricks how 
to use Swiz to complement the SDKs built in mechanism to pass data among views, how 
to integrate google maps and Mapquest, and  how to communicate effectively with a 
server using XML and JSON. You will acquire all the secret to build kick-ass applications 
that can be deployed on Apple App Store.
