Oops, I did it again. I'm talking about using a new blog engine. I started with Typo and several hosts, used octopress, and now I moved straight to [jekyll]http://jekyllrb.com. In this post I'll show you the behind the scenes and you will also find the source code of this site.


<!--more-->

* Explain why jekyll
* Explain where hosted (and why not github pages)
* What no AngularJS yet? Will move it to plain AngularJS removing all jQuery
* Bought and customize template. You'll need to buy it if you want to reuse this code.
* 

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].
