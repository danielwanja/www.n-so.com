Yesterday [18 startup lanched](http://n-so.com/blog/2013/03/04/launch-festival-day-1-startups/). Today they beat that, and what a batch it was. Including one internet connected coffee machinge that brews the perfect coffee. Here are my notes on the launched apps. As the presentation where really fast passed I certainly missed some obvious facts. I'll correct them as I find out. Again the day was organized in three launch sessions.

<!--more-->

#### Session 1
##### 19. Quick Posture

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}img/blog/20130305/quickposture.jpeg" width:"250px" />

* Glenn Bilby
* Jesper Br√§nnmark

If you are not assessing you are guessing.

* <http://quickposture.com/>
* @quickposture

* We have created the solution to assess movement and posture at glance 
* We are created a 3d images, looking at the static posture, alignments.
* You can improve the back pain ratio at your workplace from 1 in 5 to 1 in 10;

* In a private clinic we can increase the income by $900'000 a year.
* One scan is replace two weeks of doctor assessment.
<br/>
<p>
<strong>q:</strong> is this telemedecine or in the office?<br/>
<strong>a:</strong> in the early days we try to establish legitimacy, but in the future it can be made at homes.<br/>
<strong>q:</strong> how does it work with having close on? Do we need a suite like that<br/>
<strong>a:</strong> tight close works fine. If it has lot of fabric it can interfere.<br/>
<strong>q:</strong> on the hardware site do you need to big screen or can it work on an iPad<br/>
<strong>a:</strong> We are trying to standardize, therefore the special hardware. But we can use a table on a fixed <br/>standardized mount.
<strong>q:</strong> How does it compared with other Kinect solutions<br/>
<strong>a:</strong> These solutions don't reach mass markets and clinics. We are breaching this gap<br/>
<strong>q:</strong> How do you protect yourself against other using Kinect.<br/>
<strong>a:</strong> In terms of business we can partner with a hardware provider, but our business is more on the software <br/>and service side.
<strong>a:</strong> fee for service and we can hope we can provide the hardware<br/>
</p>

##### 20. Stream  nation

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}img/blog/20130305/streamnation.jpeg" width:"250px" />

* Jonhathan Benassaya
* Oren Zitoun

* <http://streamnation.com/>
* @stream_nation


* Enjoy your video library on iPad, iPhone and the web.
* Send you videos and they encode them.
* Give trusted friends access to a collection so they can watch from your library. They can do the same for you!
* Steve can upload all his dads, add content to his account with bit torrent.
* On the iPad Steve can browse his library.
* Can cache content for offline viewing

* It starts at $4/month for 100GB 

* Backuped twice
* Transcoded in 4 format

<br/>

<p>
<strong>jason: </strong>David Conehn your are nodding<br/>
<strong>q: </strong>is that a bridge solution until people are not using their dads. That problem will not be around in 5 or 10 years.<br/>
<strong>a: </strong>dvd is a way to put content in the system. We also can send a hard drive to you to give us content. The big vision of stream nation is to create a storage for you families. With the go pro people we are a content creation nation.<br/>
<strong>followup: </strong>that's not what you pitched.<br/>
<strong>q: </strong>You can download videos from iTunes. If you are in the business of saving $2 you don't have a business. You pitched us something we can already do.<br/>
<strong>a: </strong>There are many reasons you cannot enjoy your files.<br/>
<strong>followup: </strong>younger people don't have that problem right now.<br/>
<strong>followup: </strong>you need to check on copyright issues. What is the legality?<br/>
<strong>a: </strong>technically you have the right to backup dads but you cannot circumvent drm<br/>
<strong>a: </strong>we worked with lawyers and google. <br/>
<strong>followup: </strong>2 things you need to be careful. If you have online access you won't import the video, its bookmarking for video. Sending dvds is a hard user experience. You are solving a legacy problem. I think you are onto something good, you have a lot of moving parts and you need to figure out what it is.<br/>
<strong>q: </strong>how does this compare to ultraviolet offers<br/>
<strong>a: </strong>2 different things. 1 ability to add all your collection and ultraviolet is only for new content. 2 is works on all platforms. The approach we take nobody is providing this. There are not service where I can upload all my DVDs and stream them on any device.<br/>

<strong>q: </strong>self storage is a real estate market. Moving back and forth is complicate. I would be wary of solving the use case of sending boxes back and forth.<br/>

<strong>q: </strong>my worry is will it leave up to the promise. Creepy people may be recommended in the system. Do you need to curate it?<br/>
<strong>a: </strong>the women need to have 40 friends on Facebook for over than year. It's harder to game. Also if you have a choice between a random person or a recommendation from your friend‚Ä¶<br/>
<strong>q: </strong>all you revenue is hinging on one moment in time. Have you thought through the mechanics of that?<br/>
<strong>a: </strong>Our hypothesis. You know there is an expression of interest. So it's not another dating site. Someone expressed interest in you and with in app purchase, it's very easy to get the transition going. <br/>

<strong>a: </strong>200 million watched the NFL. We believe the existing commentary are highly exclusionary. <br/>
<strong>q: </strong>so hem‚Ä¶.I'm fascinated with how the television watching is changing. I do think there is lot of changes how people will watch tv. I don't know if I understand it. A huge problem is discovery. <br/>

* Version 2.0 - winner of last year demo pit.

* Brian Krejcarek
* Marcus Blankenship

* We learned a lot. Kids don't like brushing teeth and taking there medicine. But they like to play on their iPhone. 
* Demo doesn't go so well‚Ä¶could have been funny. 
* Idea is that they have a magical wand which has bluetooth and a gyroscope that can work with many apps.
* We'll present here today "Teddo". Inside he has dreams. You can put closes on which have rfid. Teddo can drive an app. So kids can play now with * real toys again.
* Teddo is $19. We are creating an App Store.

<strong>Mark: </strong>I wash wishing I had a gong here. Really that was one of the strangest thing I have seen.<br/>
<strong>Scoble: </strong>the problem went south. So it's hard mentally to get back from it. But ignoring that, there is something here, I'm just struggling with this.<br/>
<strong>Greg: </strong>I remember seeing green goose two years ago and was excited about it. What happen?<br/>
<strong>a: </strong>We didn't get enough sells. We had this idea of gamifying things. <br/>
<strong>Andy: </strong>it seems that there are lots of stabs in the dark. It's time consuming and expensive. Seems that you need to get back to the customer to find out what problems you need to solve. It may be another device that doesn't work and goes to the bin.<br/>
<strong>Scoble: </strong>I meet an inventor that sold his idea to Disney and they brought it to market.<br/>
