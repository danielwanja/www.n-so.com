If you are a Rails developer your are familiar with CoffeeScript and HAMLC. In this video I'll show you how to get started with a fork of [Angular Seed](https://github.com/danielwanja/angular-seed) that supports CoffeeScript and HAMLC asset precompilation. It's a a fast way to get started creating an AngularJS application.
<style>
  .videoWrapper {
  	position: relative;
  	padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 */
  	padding-top: 25px;
  	height: 0;
  }
  .videoWrapper iframe {
  	position: absolute;
  	top: 0;
  	left: 0;
  	width: 100%;
  	height: 100%;
  }
</style>

<div class="videoWrapper">
  <iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/105489863" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

In this video I'll show how to install the angular-seed project, run a local development server, run the unit test continuously and provide a quick walkthrough the AnguarJS application.

Enjoy!
Daniel
