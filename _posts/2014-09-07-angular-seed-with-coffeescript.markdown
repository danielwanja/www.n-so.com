If you are a Rails developer your are familiar with CoffeeScript and HAMLC. In this video I'll show you how to get started with a fork of [Angular Seed](https://github.com/danielwanja/angular-seed) that supports CoffeeScript and HAMLC asset precompilation. It's a a fast way to get started creating an AngularJS application.

In this video I'll show how to install the angular-seed project, run a local development server, run the unit test continuously and provide a quick walkthrough the AnguarJS application.

Enjoy!
