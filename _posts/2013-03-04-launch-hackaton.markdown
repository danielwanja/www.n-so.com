Before I realized that the Hackaton was conflicting with some long term ski vacation we had planned I signed up and was excited to have a more active part at the Launch Conference. By meeting tonight some of the participants I don't know if I could have programmed several days in a row with little sleep like many did. Great job 'guys'!

The winner of the Hackaton will get a $75k investment or $30k in cash.
